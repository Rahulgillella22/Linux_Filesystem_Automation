# Linux_Filesystem_Automation
Try this even shorter version:    **Automated Email System**    Sends emails when new files are created. Uses `inotifywait` for detection, `mutt` for Gmail SMTP, and maps files to class in-charges. Renames sent files (`_s` â†’ `_sent`) to prevent duplicates. Runs continuously with `nohup`.
