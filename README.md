# Linux Filesystem Automation  

## Overview  

This project automates email notifications for universities and schools whenever a new file (e.g., student records, reports, schedules) is created in a monitored directory. It ensures that each class in-charge receives relevant files automatically without manual intervention.  

## Features  

 **File Monitoring:** Uses `inotifywait` to detect new files.  
 **Class-wise Email Routing:** Sends files to the respective class in-charge.  
 **Automated Email Sending:** Uses `mutt` with Gmail SMTP for email automation.  
 **File Renaming After Sending:** Prevents duplicate emails by renaming sent files.  
 **Persistent Execution:** Runs continuously in the background using `nohup`.

## üöÄ How It Works  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Monitoring:**  
   - The script continuously watches a specific directory for new files.  
   - It identifies newly created files that follow the class naming convention (`classX_s_*`).  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Processing & Emailing:**  
   - Extracts the class name from the filename.  
   - Matches the class with the assigned in-charge email.  
   - Uses `mutt` to send the file as an email attachment.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **File Handling:**  
   - After sending the email, the script renames the file (`_s` to `_sent`) to avoid reprocessing.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Background Execution:**  
   - The script runs persistently using `nohup`, ensuring uninterrupted operation even if the terminal is closed.
